Part 2 - Decomposition

decomposition - Decomposition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand. The smaller parts can then be examined and solved, or designed individually, as they are simpler to work with.

Decrease and conqueror
- The decrease and conquer technique is similar to divide and conquer, except instead of partitioning a problem into multiple subproblems of smaller size, we use some technique to reduce our problem into a single problem that is smaller than the original.
