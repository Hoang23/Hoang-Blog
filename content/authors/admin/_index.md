Fascinated with technology, psychology and computer science, I have been learning different skills to aid my ability to explore these prospects. I am sharing my learning journey through my blog posts and projects to discover places of improvements and to revisit my progression.

My desktop environment currently consists of Debian Linux with KDE. I'm also learning emacs primarily for org-mode!
